# AvaBridge - Liquidity Bridge for Avalanche Subnets

AvaBridge is a production-ready liquidity bridge protocol that allows users on any Avalanche subnet to access liquidity and yield opportunities on the C-Chain with a single transaction. This solves the liquidity fragmentation problem across Avalanche's subnet ecosystem.

## üöÄ Features

- **Single Transaction Bridging**: Bridge liquidity from any subnet to C-Chain DeFi protocols with one click
- **Automated Yield Generation**: Automatically deposit bridged funds into high-yield DeFi protocols
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live tracking of liquidity flow, yield generation, and user activity
- **Secure & Trustless**: Built on Avalanche's Interchain Messaging (ICM) protocol
- **Production Ready**: Complete smart contract suite with comprehensive testing and deployment scripts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **Sender.sol** - Deployed on subnets, handles user deposits and initiates ICM calls
2. **Receiver.sol** - Deployed on C-Chain, receives ICM messages and interacts with DeFi protocols
3. **MockLendingPool.sol** - Simulates DeFi lending protocol for yield generation (5% APY)

### Frontend

- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript
- **Wagmi** for Web3 integration
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design system
- **Real-time statistics** and yield tracking
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or Core Wallet

### 1. Clone and Install

\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd avabridge
npm install
\`\`\`

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file:

\`\`\`env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
\`\`\`

### 3. Deploy Smart Contracts

#### Local Development

\`\`\`bash
# Start local Hardhat network
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts to local network
npm run deploy:local

# Test contracts
npm run test
\`\`\`

#### Avalanche Fuji Testnet

\`\`\`bash
# Get testnet AVAX from faucet: https://faucet.avax.network
# Deploy to Fuji testnet
npm run deploy:fuji
\`\`\`

### 4. Start Frontend

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## üìã Smart Contract Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

\`\`\`bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run deployment script
npm run deploy:local

# Run contract tests
node scripts/test-contracts.js
\`\`\`

## üåê Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Smart Contracts**: Deploy to Avalanche Mainnet and target subnets
2. **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel or similar platform
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment variables

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Smart contracts deployed and verified
- [ ] Frontend deployed with correct contract addresses
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Wallet integration tested
- [ ] Cross-chain messaging verified
- [ ] Yield generation confirmed

## üîß Configuration

### Contract Addresses

Update contract addresses in `hooks/use-bridge.ts` after deployment:

\`\`\`typescript
const SENDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'your_deployed_sender_address'
const RECEIVER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'your_deployed_receiver_address'
\`\`\`

### Supported Networks

- **Avalanche C-Chain** (Mainnet: 43114, Fuji: 43113)
- **Custom Subnets** (Configure in `components/web3-provider.tsx`)

## üìä Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Bridge Fees**: 0.1-0.5% on cross-chain transactions
2. **Liquidity Partner Fees**: Revenue sharing with DeFi protocols
